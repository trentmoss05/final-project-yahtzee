          <p>
            Yahtzee is a game of luck and chance. The object of the game is to
            score the most points possible by rolling 5 dice to make specific
            combos. There are 13 rounds, and with each round you roll the dice
            score in one of the categories. Some categories have requirements
            that must be met.
          </p>

          <p>
            All you need to play is 5 six-sided dice, a cup if you want to roll
            them with, a pencil, and paper to record everyone's scores. You can
            play alone to see how high of a score you can get, or play against
            friends. Each player rolls the 5 dice and the highest roll gets to
            go first.
